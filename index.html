      <h4>Event cards</h4> 
      <p>Event cards prevent all players to do certain actions or give players a chance to earn rewards.<br>
      Each event card has a turn counter that determinates how long card stay in play.<br>Z means that the turn number is multiplied by current zone difficulty.<br>
      When there is no event card in play or the latest event ended, draw a new event card.<br>
      Shuffle event cards when last one expires.<br>
      Wingman and rare cargo events require players to protect A.I. ship. All enemy ships will deal damage to players ship before A.I. ships in these events.</p>

      <h4>NPC Trust</h4>
      <p>Players try to gain trust of NPC factions to gain their help by doing missions for them.<br>
        Players start the game with zero trust points.<br>
        When new NPC is made the old trust points carry over to it.<br>
        Each completed loyalty mission increase trust points by 1.<br><br>
        Players total trust:	X is the number of players</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If players total  trust >= 40X, all of the ships are in players control.</li>
      <li>If players total trust >= 35X, 3/4 of the NPC fleet is in players control.</li>
      <li>If players total trust >= 30X, all of the ships protect players shipyards.</li>
      <li>If players total trust >= 25X, half of the NPC fleet is in players control.</li>
      <li>If players total  trust >= 20X, 3/4 of the ships protect players shipyards.</li>
      <li>If players total trust >= 15X, 1/4 of the NPC fleet is in players control.</li>
      <li>If players total trust >= 10X, half of the ships protect players shipyards.</li>
      <li>If players total trust >= 5X, 1/4 of the ships protect players shipyards.</li>
   </ol>
      <h4>Space fleet:</h4>
	<p>Maximum fleet size is 5 ships for each player/A.I.. (6 for conquering A.I.) 
	Only 5 ships can be moved to target location from one location.
      If there would be more than 5 ships in one location other than in A.I. homeplanets, all the newest arrivals are returned to their previous locations.</p>
    </section><br>  
    <section class="main-section" id="Space_Battle">
      <header><h3>Space Battle</h3></header>
      <p>If ships from two different races arrive to target battle at same time the one that has faster engine will start.<br> If engine is even the one who moved from the nearest location will start.<br> If it is still even, the earlier race will start.</p><br>
      <h4>Starting the battle</h4>
      <p>Set each player ship tokens at the one side of the battlefield and enemies at opposite side starting from the smallest ships.</p><br>
      <h4>Ships weapon limitations</h4>
      <p>Interceptors only use one weapon in combat, frigates two weapons and so on.</p><br>
      <h4>Turn structure</h4>
    <ol>    
      <li>Interceptor vs. Interceptor</li>
		<p>All damage in the round is done simultaniously
		All the damage are added together and in the end of the round distributed between enemy ships structure points.
          A.I. will always use the weapon(s) that deals the most damage. If this is even use the list below to determinate the weapon used.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Beam weapons </li>
			-Check out platings and force fields for defense
        <li>Interceptors weapons</li>

		same that in ints vs. ints
	and so on...
    </ol>
      <p>When there is no larger ships to add in the battle, just repeat last round.<br> 
      Shipyard counts as the largest ship in the battle so it joins the battle a round after every other ship has joined.<br>
        A.I. will distribute damage so it kills as much the largest ships as possible then second largest etc. Extra damage is dealt to the largest ship left.<br> Shipyard counts as the smallest ship for this rule.</p>
      <h4>Battle rules</h4>
      <p>Each weapon can only be activated once each round.<br>
      All the same weapons fire at the same time.<br>
      Players can fix their damaged ships after the battle.<br> Repairing one structure point costs 10 credits.<br>
        All the damaged A.I. ships will withdraw to their base/homeworld for repairs.</p>
      <h4>Retreating from battle</h4>
      <p>When ship decides to leave the battle mark it's token down, it will still  participiate in the next round of the battle.<br>After that round it moves back to the tile it came from.<br> 
        A.I. ships won't retreat.</p>
    <h4>Land army</h4>
    <p>
	Maximum land army size = (Largest ship size + compaction bonus)/5 
	Starting unit limit for each unit = 5
    A.I.'s space cadet limit in infinite.</p>
    <pre><code>
    <strong>Land unit	       	Hp	Damage	  Targets	Size	    Cost</strong><br>	
    Space cadet	   1	      1		1	  1		10

    Space marine	   2	      2		1	  1		100	
    Attack drone	   2	      2		4	  2		300

      <h4>Land battle</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Each side of battle chooses one land unit group that deals damage to target land 	unit stack simultaniously.</li>
        <li>Remove all death units from each targeted unit stack. Land units cannot be injured.</li> 
        <li>Each side chooses unused land unit stack that deals damage to target land unit 	stack simultaniously.</li> 
	and so on, until all stacks have been used. Then start with phase 1 again.

      <h4>Repairing/Refitting/Scrapping</h4>
      <p>Repairing one structure point costs 10 credits.<br>
        Repairing shipyard costs 10 credits/sp.<br>
        Refitting old ships is possible, but you have to pay the full cost of the new ship part for each ship you have and all those ship need to be in your shipyard.<br> Refitting means changing the ship parts not getting better layouts.</p><br>

      <h4>Designing new layouts</h4>
        <p>Almost each ship part has 5 five levels of layouts.<br> So you must design it five time over to get the maximum value.<br>
        Designing cost is research cost/5.<br>
          You get one layout card for each 2 points of your ENG. You can buy one of them.</p><br>
